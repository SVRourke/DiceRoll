This is an app that allows people suffering from blindness or visual impairment to use a screen reader to roll the 6 different sized dice necessary to play the game dungeons and dragons and recieve audible feedback using the browser speechsynthesis api.

## Concept
The most simplified explanation of this app is it is a randomn number generator with a set of preset ceilings consisting of 4, 6, 8, 10 and 20. to be used in different situations. The app then uses speech synthesis to read the generated number
