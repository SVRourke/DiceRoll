        <h2>What is DiceRoll?</h2>
        <p>
            DiceRoll is an app which allows people who suffer from blindness or visual impairment to 
            roll the dice necessary to play Dungeons and Dragons.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Wiki</a>

            When a die is rolled 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#Polyhedral_dice">(D4-D20)</a> the result is displayed in large text and spoken by the browser
            using the SpeechSynthesis API.

        <h3>Accessibility in web design:</h3>   
        <p>
            We are currently living in a time where technology has brought people together in ways unimaginable
            by our predecessors. Half a century ago you could speak with someone on the opposite side of the planet,
            as long a you had their phone number and cash to burn. Though it was relatively exclusive that level of 
            connectivity changed the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now in the third decade of the new millennium I can pick up my phone, hop
            on social media and speak face to face with multiple people across the globe at the same time, I can even
            exchange messages with someone in space orbiting the planet!
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not the case for all however, though in the immediate our advances have the capacity to provide
            great benefit to a large number of people, others are often unable to take advantage of those benefits
            due to disabilities. So this is my first contribution to making sure everyone gets the benefits, though 
            It's just a simple tool for entertainment I really hope it can make someone's life better.
